<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>To facilitate the ability of users to vote, we create a unique 'voter ID',
which is generated using the following information:</p>
<ul>
  <li>IP address</li>
  <li>User-agent header</li>
  <li>Random number generated at that instance <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper_(cryptography)"
      target="_blank">(pepper)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>An irreversable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function"
  target="_blank">cryptographic hash</a> is created using this information in
order to roughly identify a user, allowing us to keep track of upvotes without
de-anonymising users. This hash is not linked with your session.</p>

<p>On the <a href="/complaints">complaints page</a>, users may leave an email
address if further correspondence is required. Complaints can not be linked
with the session, or any post under the ticketing system.</p>

<p>We do log requests as you browse the services and store it for 30 days:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your IP address</li>
  <li>What was requested</li>
  <li>Was the request a success</li>
</ul>

<p>The purpose of this data collection is to help us identify any potential
abuse.</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>Session cookies ("hithereimacookie") are used to generate a temporary
username, allowing a user to comment anonymously and create discussions. These
sessions are set to expire in one month. This session is not linked with the
voter ID.</p>

<p>Examples of data stored on a session:</p>

<div class="card col-4">
  <h3 class="noTopMargin">Grateful Golang</h3>
  <p>Session ID: c2c1390516e18d14</p>
</div>

<h2>Third Parties</h2>
<p>There's only one party happening here. No information is shared with third
parties.</p>

<h2>Changes</h2>
<p>We, the current class representatives, reserve the right to make any changes to this privacy policy. Notice will be
  given as an alert on the <a href="/">homepage</a>.</p>
